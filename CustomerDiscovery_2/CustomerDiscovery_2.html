		<div> The Jobs-To-Be-Done Framework
</div>
		<div>The Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework is a conceptual approach to viewing a product through a lens of what customers are hiring a product to do for them.
</div>
		<div>Customers don’t buy products, they ‘’hire products’’ to do a job 
</div>
		<div>Before planning a customer discovery sprint and diving into performing customer interviews, it is important to (re)iterate a basic frame of reference in the lean startup methodology. That is: 


This viewpoint is a central tenet of Jobs Theory and of the Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework.

</div>
		<div>Customer Forces & JTBD
</div>
		<div>To help frame your customers’ experience and the challenges and achievements that shape their buying decisions, we look to the Customer Forces Canvas. The Customer Forces Canvas is a behavioural model created by Ash Maurya that describes the causal forces (PUSH, PULL, INERTIA, and FRICTION) that shape how people select and use a solution (product/service) for a specific job-to-be-done. 
</div>

		<div>JTBD: Ulwick
</div>
		<div>This 8-minute video, Tony Ulwick presents an overview of Jobs-to-be-Done Theory — a powerful lens through which can offer companies can a mechanism to identify and observe customer needs.

</div>
		<div>Traditionally, businesses (both new and established) have taken a product-centric approach. This means that they have focused on product features and functionality that might be marketable to an identified market demographic. 
The product-centric approach has been taught by business schools for decades, but this approach has been challenged in recent years due to a shift from traditional industries that manufacture products to leaner, more agile companies that create digital products.

		<div>JTBD: Christensen
</div>
		<div>In this 7-minute video, Clayton Christensen discusses the impact of JTBD on McDonald’s and their insights and innovations on the milkshake.
</div>
		<div>Katelyn Bourgoin & JTBD
</div>
		<div>If you participated in Propel’s Validation program, you had the opportunity to hear Katelyn Bourgoin’s startup journey already. We recommend you review Katelyn’s video even if you’ve seen it previously. If you’re new to Katelyn, you’re in for a treat. Katelyn’s grit and perseverance to get to the root of the highs and lows she encountered as a founder led her to recognize the importance of the JTBD framework first-hand –– but not before she collected her fair share of battle scars.
</div>
		<div>Katelyn Bourgoin</div>
		<div>As Katelyn states, it’s “not about understanding the problems that customers have. It’s about understanding the progress they are trying to make and the context of their situation”. The benefits of this new knowledge are plentiful:
Understanding who your customers are and how to position your offering
Improving the messaging your marcom materials
Identifying new markets, channels, or tactics to try
Discovering specific ways to improve your product/customer experience
</div>
		<div>Jobs-To-Be-Done
</div>
		<div>This knowledge can have a direct impact on the productivity and innovativeness of your business too. As startups focus on understanding the customer and their jobs, empathy is built and psychological inertia is broken. Customer interviews result in new information that shifts thinking and informs ideation.</div>
		<div>To understand the customer’s job-to-be-done is to understand what the customer really wants. This is a simple, yet direct route to determining the desirability of your solution.
</div>
		<div>Understanding "The Customer"
</div>
		<div>The customer is primarily interested in what job a product can do for him/her.

Their buying behaviour will be a direct indicator of a product’s ability to service that job. 
</div>
		<div>JTBD: Bourgoin
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>In this 45-minute video, Katelyn shares her story, her discovery of the JTBD framework, and why she believes it is vital to the success of your business. 

</div>
		<div>In this new business landscape, where the need for speed has become more important, putting the customer at the centre of the decision-making process has provided a direct route to validating assumptions and ideas faster.

</div>
		<div>The Customer Forces Canvas helps founders visualise a customer’s behavioural states and outcomes as they engage with a solution. It is a useful model to use in combination with the JTBD framework as it can facilitate extracting insights into why customers do what they do. 

</div>
		<div>If you’ve been exposed to LeanStack’s Customer Forces Canvas already, you’ll recognize that all customer jobs start with a triggering event. The triggering event is where JTBD lives.</div>
		<div>When interviewing customers, you can use the Customer Forces Canvas to extract information about the causal forces that shape how customers select and use a solution.

Customers hire (buy and use) solutions in response to a job that they need or want to do. If the solution they have chosen does not live up to expectations, a switching trigger results and the customer may seek out a new and different solution to complete the job-to-be-done.

		<div>Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD)
</div>
		<div>“Jobs-to-be-done” was developed by Tony Ulwick and articulated by the late Clayton Christensen, the renowned academic and business consultant, who also developed the theory of "disruptive innovation”. 

According to Christensen, the shift to a customer-centric way of thinking represents a crucial step for startup founders.
