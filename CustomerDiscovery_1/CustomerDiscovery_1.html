Frameworks can help you plan and excute Cuatomer Discovery.

In module 2 of this series, we’ll examine the Jobs-To-Be-Done framework and the Customer Forces Canvas and show you how to use these tools to help guide your customer discovery.</div>
		<div>So, talking to customers is how you uncover problems worth solving, but let’s be honest, standing in front of customers, talking to them, observing them, and extracting insights is not that easy. In addition to not knowing how to start a conversation with customers (which we cover in “Methods to Help You Interview”), many founders are challenged by: Knowing who to interviewKnowing how to find customers to interviewKnowing how to overcome their own biasesKnowing how to get feedback or get quality feedbackKnowing how to ensure interview information isn’t lostKnowing how to recognize insights, and so, and so on…</div>
		<div>If you are interested in learning more about customer development and the concepts that inform the customer discovery process, we recommend the following resources:Lean Customer Development by Cindy Alverez (on Amazon)The Mom Test by Rob Fitzpatrick (on Amazon)Steve Blanks, Getting Out of the Building. 2 Minutes to See Why (on YouTube 6-min video)The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win by Steve Blank (on Amazon)The Entrepreneur's Guide to Customer Development: A cheat sheet to The Four Steps to the Epiphany by Brant Cooper (on Amazon)The Startup Owner’s Manual by Steve Blank (on Amazon)</div>

		<div>In 1990, Steve Blank introduced a methodology for customer development that was intended to help startups and entrepreneurs improve their products' success. In his first book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win, Blank outlined a systematic process for guiding entrepreneurs in their search for a “repeatable and scalable business model”. The process was founded on a simple and fairly obvious idea: talk directly to your customers (or potential customers)! 
Blank’s message to founders was clear: “get out of the building” and put yourself in front of customers. The outcome of this, he argued, was a direct path to validation.
</div>
		<div>A Brief History of Customer Discovery
</div>
		<div>4</div>
		<div>Blank’s work heavily influenced and was integrated into the Lean Startup methodology, and in his second book, The Startup Owner’s Manual, Blank further refined the customer development process into the following 4 steps:
</div>
		<div>Test your Problem</div>
		<div>1

</div>
		<div>Pivot or Proceed</div>
		<div>State your Hypothesis</div>
		<div>2</div>
		<div>Test your Solution</div>
		<div>3
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>In this 3-minute video entitled Customer Discovery - How to Build a Startup, Steve Blank provides an overview of these steps and explains the importance of the cyclical process of customer discovery in validating your business model.

</div>
		<div>Talking to Customers
</div>
		<div>Given the range of ways we can reach out to and connect with customers, talking to customers may sound like a pretty straightforward task. In your day-to-day communication, you likely have a range of ways to connect with others, most of which are aided by technology. But, a word of caution: while technology can certainly help in verifying insights from customer interviews, technological solutions such as emails or surveys should not replace engaging with your customers directly.

</div>
		<div>In this short video, Marcel Lebrun talks about the insights he gained from getting out of the building and talking to (and observing) his customers in their own environment. As you will learn, the impacts of customer discovery to his startup were crucial to its ultimate success.

continuous learning</div>
		<div>There’s a lot of “continuous” in this formula and you may be wondering what this all means for you and your time. Fear not! Ash clarifies that to adopt and embody this mindset does not mean endless interviewing. Rather, it means:Continuously monitoring what is changingBaselining what you know</div>
		<div>In Leanstack, Ash Maurya frames the work of customer discovery, positioning it as a central mechanism for cultivating a mindset of continuous innovation.
