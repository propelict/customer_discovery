</div>
		<div>How do I reach out to potential customers? What should I say? How can I learn from talking to customers? Founders typically have a plethora of questions in the early days of customer discovery. This module is intended to provide you with some answers and enable you with a variety of methods that will increase your chances of uncovering what your customers really want.
</div>
		<div>The Process of Customer Discovery
</div>
		<div>You’ve reached the end of this course. In this module, you were provided with a variety of tools, techniques, and methods to help you get the most out of customer discovery and increase your success of acquiring insights that reveal what your customers truly want. 
Making customer discovery part of your startup’s culture will go a long way towards building an organisation that continues to learn and evolve. 
</div>
		<div>Putting It Into Practice
</div>
		<div>To put you on the road to success, we have created a practice activity to help kick start your customer discovery work.

Read through the activity on the following screen and if you find yourself unsure in any areas, take time to revisit some of the resources made available to you in this course.

		<div>Michael Sippey is an entrepreneur who has spent the last 20 years building tech products. In this 20-minute video, Micheal conveys how he used the principles of customer discovery to understand his customers and the forces and triggers that influenced their buy behaviours. In his words, “if you can’t get 30 meetings, you don’t have a product….so smile and dial!”
</div>
		<div>Download The Clarity Calls Playbooks
</div>
		<div>We recommend that you download Katelyn Bourgoin’s “Clarity Calls” Playbooks. These playbooks have been specifically created to provide structure and guidance through all aspects of customer discovery using a 5-part Clarity Calls process. Katelyn describes Clarity Calls as “a simple yet highly effective approach to using 1:1 interviews to get explosive clarity about what works with any audience, fast”.

</div>
		<div>Step A: Create a Plan

Before you can start lining up interviews, you’ll need to first determine who you should talk to.
Ash Maurya offers some clear direction. You can talk to:People who are trying to solve the problem you have identifiedPeople who recently bought from youPeople who recently bought from a direct competitor (If you don’t have any direct competitors, talk to an indirect competitor)People who are currently in the buying journeyHow you reach these customers will likely be your next question. If customers are not currently known to you, don’t be afraid to ask for introductions from “first degree contacts”. Your personal and professional networks will be important tools in identifying and reaching out to customers for an interview.</div>

		<div>1B:  Use your Network

Consider using your networks and the following channels to find customers to interview:
Trade shows related to your product or industrySpeaking engagements related to your fieldSocial networks, including:Facebook groupsTwitterSubredditsLinkedInA Note for Multi-Sided Businesses: If you have a multi-sided business model, you will likely have identified different groups of users and/or customers. To help you better organise your customer discovery efforts, make the interviewing task easier, and ensure your data analysis is more targeted, you may wish to segment your interviews upfront into these different groups.

</div>
		<div>1C:  Use LinkedIn

LinkedIn can be powerful tools for finding and connecting to customers. LinkedIn offers both paid and free versions. In the free version, you can:Investigate your competitor’s networks: LinkedIn members' networks are searchable (provided they haven’t opted to protect them).Check out the “People Also Viewed” sidebar (peruse the profile of a customer or prospect to see other users that LinkedIn has identified as similar to your contact).Leverage the power of Search: LinkedIn has a powerful built-in search engine that lets you zero-in on promising businesses and individuals. Learn more about leveraging LinkedIn’s search capability.Join Groups: Join relevant groups that contain professionals who might be your customers.</div>
		<div>. . . . . . . </div>
		<div>1C:  Use LinkedIn

As an alternative, LinkedIn Sales Navigator is a paid tool that provides access to advanced search features that can help you find quality leads easily. If you are interested in investing time and money in using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, the following 13-minute video will help you get started. The tool is available as a free trial for a limited period, so you could determine if it is useful for you before committing. This 13-minute video can help you get started.

		<div>1D:  Reach Out Using Email

When reaching out to prospective customers, it’s important to carefully tailor your language to receive a positive impression and response. Remember, your goal is learning not selling at this point. In fact, being transparent and open in your intention to learn about them will go a long way towards securing the interview, and in disarming them during the interview itself.

For making initial contact with customers in a text-based form (via email or a messaging app), it’s a good idea to use a templated script. This will ensure consistency in your communication and will help speed things up. 

If you’re not sure what to say, Katelyn Bourgoin has included several examples of informal and formal emails to prospective customers in the Clarity Calls playbooks that you can use to help you get started. Locate the Interview Request Templates.pdf to craft a message that will be positively received from your customers and get them to commit to the interview.

		<div>1E:  Pick Up The Phone

One of the toughest challenges for many founders is reaching out to customers over the phone. Many founders have grown up with email and text as a prefered mode of communication for both business and personal matters. As a result, the art of talking to people over the telephone has become a bit of a lost art. While your emails may have proven effective for most transactions, the reality is that direct communication is best for customer discovery.

This short article (8 min read) from the Harvard Business Review takes the position that email often allows us to “avoid authentic communication or persuasive communication…[and] robs us of the ability to get better at either or both”.

		<div>1F:  Tips From ’The Phone Lady’

Our regular Propel speaker, Mary Jane Copps (aka The Phone Lady), maintains that there are 4 key elements to excellent, effective conversations that can help founders in their engagement with customers:Get to know the backstory of your customer: Find out a bit about the customer’s life - it can help you engage them and speak to them in a meaningful way to ensure you are heard.

Leave messages that customer want to return: Use a script for your message. Specify your availability for a call-back and that you’ll follow up via email as it may be more convenient for them. This shows that you respect their time.

Inspire a conversation when you engage with your customer: Remember to be careful about your language. Be assertive and professional. Listen to what they have to say.

Ensure you nurture the conversation: Allow the customer to share their expertise, experience and story. Dig deeper by asking them to tell you more.</div>

		<div>1G:  Tackle Phone Anxiety

While we may have you convinced that calling your customers is the most effective way to reach out, you may also be feeling somewhat (or perhaps very) anxious about it. If this sounds like you, this 7-minute video from Matt Macnamara will be worth a watch. 

While Matt’s ultimate goal is selling to customers, the principles for overcoming call anxiety are directly transferable to customer discovery. His inspiring story is worth a watch.

		<div>Explore the steps involved in the second stage of customer discovery: interviewing
</div>
		<div>2A: Adopt a Discovery Mindset

How do you talk to customers to uncover what job they are hiring a solution for? Customers often don’t know what they want –– and sometimes they don’t want to tell you. These challenges, along with preconceptions and biases you or your customers may have, can easily result in a failure to get to the root of what job your customers are hiring a product to do. 
As a first step toward cutting through these tricky challenges and increasing your interview success, Ash Maurya suggests you approach customer interviews with a discovery mindset and not a problem validation mindset. In fact, he recommends avoiding the word “problem” altogether when engaging with customers. You may have noticed that we’re repeating ourselves a bit here. That’s because shifting and maintaining a discovery mindset is one of the biggest challenges for founders since it requires a complete re-learning of some deeply ingrained habits.</div>
		<div>2. Run the Interview</div>
		<div>2B: Follow Expert Advice

Some expert guidance from Ash:Conduct your interviews face-to-facePick a neutral locationAsk for sufficient timeConsider outsourcing interview schedulingConduct interviews in pairsAsk questions, don’t make assertionsFocus on facts, not hypotheticalsGo deep, be curiousChase the bigger contextRecord the interview (if possible)Re-create the timeline of events:Use a meta-script</div>

		<div>5 Whys
Example</div>
		<div>Because the CTO believes that new employees don’t need thorough training and they should learn while working.</div>
		<div>2C: Use the 5 Whys

We’ve mentioned a technique called the 5 Whys a few times, so it is probably worth an explanation. The 5 Whys method is a simple, yet powerful, interview technique in which the interviewer asks for the background of the problem. The technique was originally developed by Sakichi Toyoda who stated that "by repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear." 







Give it a try yourself! This technique can be easily practised with anyone. Once you’ve adopted the technique, you can use it to dive deeper during your customer interviews.

		<div>2D: Use a Meta-Script

Customer interviews can unfold in a variety of ways. To ensure you have control of the direction your interviews take and maintain a focus on your learning goals, you will want to use a meta-script. As Ash advises, you shouldn’t use your script to speak directly from but instead use it as a tool to guide the interview.
Katelyn Bourgoin has provided a Customer Interview Scripts.pdf resource that you can use to craft how you approach your customer interview.</div>

</div>
		<div>3. Extract Insights</div>
		<div>3A: Use a Systematic Approach

The goal of the interviews is to “summarise your learnings into actionable insights that describe the most common customer journey stories”. There isn’t an infinite number of stories. If you are consistent with your interviews, patterns emerge quickly (~10-20 interviews). According to Ash, these will take the shape of 3-5 stories that can be seen to be recurring.
How do you find patterns?
You may have already noticed patterns emerging after a few interviews. However, to avoid cognitive bias, you will want to approach your analysis in a more systematic way. One approach is to use the customer forces canvas to capture and rank your insights. Katelyn Bourgoin offers an alternate canvas for capturing insights. The canvases and the guidance around their usage does differ, but they are ultimately serving the same purpose: to provide a systematic way of summarising your insights. The choice of canvas will be based on your personal preference and what works more effectively for your customer interviews.</div>
		<div>. . . . . . </div>
		<div>Download the Guide to the Customer Forces Canvas</div>
		<div>. . . . . . </div>
		<div>3B: Use the Customer Forces Canvas
The Customer Forces Canvas is a useful tool for visualising your customer’s journey. The canvas is an effective tool to use during your customer interviews for capturing insights. Ash offer the following tips to help you make the most out of this process: Summarise your insights immediately after each interview: Once the interview is over, playback the interview in your mind and summarise your insights on a Customer Forces Canvas. Allocate ~15 minutes immediately after the interview to translate and transfer your notes into the canvas.Avoid groupthink: If you conducted your interview in pairs, don’t create a single canvas. Instead, you should each create a canvas and then compare them. This will ensure independent interpretations are captured.Fill out the Customer Forces Canvas in chronological order: Aim to fill out the canvas in the chronological order of the customer’s journey (as noted in the downloadable guide). This likely will not match the order in which you took notes, but this approach will allow you to reconstruct the customer’s journey.</div>
		<div>3C: Use the Post-Interview Summary

Katelyn Bourgoin offers an alternate canvas for capturing insights. In your Clarity Calls package, locate the Post-Interview Summary.pdf to use this canvas for capturing your insights.
It is useful to note that Katelyn’s guidance on the interview procedure and use of the canvas varies slightly from Ash’s. Katelyn recommends:Scheduling a 30-minute meeting for your customer interview.Blocking off another 30 minutes for over-run and for completing the Interview Summary.Complete the Interview Summary immediately after the interview the conversation will be fresh in your mind.If you interviewed in pairs, complete the Interview Summary together and discuss any insights you heard.</div>

		<div>3D: Streamline your Data Collection

If you’re not inclined to take hand-written interview notes or you are compiling your notes into electronic form, you may wish to use an alternate process that many Propel founders have adopted to streamline their data collection.
Create and use a Google Form to input your interview insights: You can create your own form using the reference elements from the Clarity Calls templates or the Customer Force Canvas. Then, to help  to compile your answers into one document, you can define a Google sheet as the destination for your responses. 
The setup can be found at: https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2917686</div>
		<div>3E: Review your Findings

How can you translate this information into something actionable? 
Once you have captured your interview insights using your canvas of choice, you will want to seek out patterns in the data. To do this, look for common patterns in the following customer forces categories:the triggering eventsthe desired outcomesthe existing alternatives</div>
		<div>. . . . . . </div>
		<div>. . . . . . </div>
		<div>3F: Organise your Findings

Reviewing these insights and organising them into customer forces categories will enable you to group your customers into customer story clusters. The following example was extracted from page 196 of Ash Maurya’s Running Lean (2022) as the top customer story clusters from a homebuilder case study:

Switching TriggerDesired OutcomeChosen Solution
Holiday party Want a bigger house for more entertaining space (growing family) Picked a 3,000 sq ft home 
Expecting a baby Want 2 extra rooms & a backyard Moved to the suburbs 
Moving for a job Want to be close to work Picked a home within 5 miles of work 

Knowing the switching triggers and desired outcomes for the majority of your customers will enable you to better understand how to design your solution to trigger such a switch and meet their needs.</div>
